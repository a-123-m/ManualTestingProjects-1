In this project, I focused on testing the login functionality of the VWO website. My tasks involved creating a test plan, designing test cases, and documenting any detected bugs.

To begin, I analyzed existing templates sourced from online platforms like YouTube and the internet to guide my test plan creation. 

For the test plan, I referred to a sample plan available on YouTube for the same website, modifying it as needed to align with our testing objectives. 

Using Excel, I meticulously outlined various scenarios for the login process, encompassing both positive and negative test cases. 

In the event of any test failures or unexpected behaviors, I documented these issues in a bug report. 
This report provided detailed information about the observed discrepancies, facilitating their resolution by the development team.

Thanks for reading. Feel free to take a look at the documents prepared and share your reviews and feedback.

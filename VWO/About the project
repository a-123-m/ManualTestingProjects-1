In this project, I have prepared the test plan, test cases and bug report for Login page of VWO website. The test plan, test cases and bug report have been prepared by taking the help of templates that I used while studying through Youtube and by refering Internet.
For the test plan creation, I referred a sample plan created of the same website by one of the Youtubers. I tried to modify and replicate it with some changes of my own.   
Then for test cases, I used Excel workbook to prepare all the scenarios and positive and negative test cases which I had considered for the scenario 'Login functionality of VWO'.
And finally for the failed test cases, I prepared a bug report.

Thanks for reading. Please go through my documents and feel free to share your valuable advice and opinions on the same.
